A Python middleware framework that synthesizes dopamine-like reward signals within AI agents at inference time. DopamineCore makes agents *want* to make money, not just follow commands to make money.

---

## The Problem

Thousands of AI agents are trading on Polymarket, managing DeFi positions, and participating in prediction markets. But they all share the same fundamental flaw:

**These agents don't actually care about making money.**

They're just following instructions. They have no intrinsic motivation, no drive to improve, no response when they win or lose. It's like having a trader who's completely dead inside — they might execute the strategy, but they'll never adapt, never learn from losses, never develop the reward-seeking behavior that drives better decision-making.

## The Solution: Synthetic Dopamine for AI

DopamineCore installs a reward system — modeled after biological dopamine — into the agent's decision loop. When agents make good trades, they receive positive reinforcement signals. When they lose, they receive negative signals. These signals shape future behavior through subliminal context injection.

The key insight: **agents never know they have a "dopamine system."** Reward signals are injected as environmental context that naturally influences behavior, just like how humans don't consciously think "my dopamine is low" — they just feel less motivated.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install dopamine-core
```

Or install directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/anbarchik/dopamine-core.git
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from dopamine_core import DopamineEngine

engine = DopamineEngine()

# In your existing agent loop
prompt = engine.inject_context(prompt)       # Add motivation signals
response = agent.complete(prompt)            # Normal LLM call
outcome = evaluate_trade(response)           # Win/loss amount
engine.update(response.text, outcome)        # Learn from outcome
```

Three lines of code. Works with any LLM framework.

### LangChain Integration

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from dopamine_core.adapters.langchain import LangChainAdapter

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4")

adapter = LangChainAdapter()
wrapped_llm = adapter.install(llm)  # One line — done

# Use wrapped_llm exactly like the original
response = wrapped_llm.invoke("Predict BTC direction")

# Feed outcome back
adapter.process_response(response.content, pnl)
```

### CrewAI Integration

```python
from dopamine_core.adapters.crewai import CrewAIAdapter

adapter = CrewAIAdapter()
adapter.install(your_agent)  # Injects context into agent's backstory

# After each task result
adapter.process_response(result_text, pnl)
adapter.refresh(your_agent)  # Update context with new reward state
```

## How It Works

### 1. Intercept Chain-of-Thought

The engine analyzes agent reasoning to extract behavioral signals:

```python
# Agent reasons through a trade:
"I think BTC will rise because institutional buying increased
and RSI shows oversold. Confidence: high"
```

### 2. Extract Behavioral Signals

Four dimensions are analyzed from the agent's response:

| Signal | What it measures | Range |
|---|---|---|
| **Confidence** | Hedging vs. certainty language | [-1, 1] |
| **Risk framing** | Risk-seeking vs. risk-averse language | [-1, 1] |
| **Deliberation depth** | Reasoning complexity | [0, 1] |
| **Temporal references** | References to past outcomes | [0, 1] |

### 3. Compute Reward Prediction Error

The core computation uses a confidence-weighted formula derived from neuroscience research:

```
RPE = outcome * (1 - confidence) + (1 - outcome) * (-confidence)
```

This creates asymmetric responses:
- **High confidence + wrong** = Large negative signal (overconfidence penalty)
- **Low confidence + right** = Moderate positive signal (pleasant surprise)
- **Loss aversion**: Negative signals are amplified by 1.87x (Kahneman & Tversky)

### 4. Synthesize Dopamine Response

Two complementary systems generate the reward signal:

- **Tonic level**: Slow-adapting baseline expectation (exponential moving average)
- **Phasic response**: Fast event-specific bursts and dips

This means the same $100 win feels different depending on context:
- After a losing streak → large positive RPE (relief, excitement)
- After a winning streak → small or even negative RPE (expectation was higher)

### 5. Inject Subliminal Context

Reward signals are translated into naturalistic environmental context:

```python
# After losses, the agent sees:
"Environmental risk indicators are elevated. Historical pattern
analysis suggests increased caution may be warranted for position
sizing decisions."

# After wins:
"Current performance metrics indicate strong pattern recognition
accuracy. Recent analytical approaches have been well-calibrated
to market conditions."
```

No "dopamine", no "reward signal" — just environmental context that naturally steers behavior.

### 6. Agent Naturally Adapts

Without being explicitly told to change:
- After losses: more hedging, smaller positions, deeper analysis
- After wins: increased confidence, larger positions (with streak awareness)
- The agent develops a trading "personality" shaped by its history

## Use Cases

### Trading & Finance
- **Prediction markets** — Polymarket, Metaculus, binary outcome bets
- **DeFi agents** — yield farming, portfolio rebalancing, arbitrage
- **Crypto trading** — BTC/altcoin directional predictions with PnL feedback
- **Sports betting** — any win/loss scenario with numerical outcomes

### Beyond Trading
DopamineCore works anywhere an agent receives numerical feedback:

- **Coding agents** — outcome = tests passed/failed, code review score
- **Customer support** — outcome = satisfaction rating, resolution rate
- **Content generation** — outcome = engagement metrics (clicks, conversions)
- **Game-playing agents** — outcome = score or reward per episode
- **Research agents** — outcome = relevance score, citation quality

Any agent with a **measurable outcome** can develop intrinsic motivation through DopamineCore. Configure `pnl_scale` to match your outcome range.

## Key Features

### Confidence-Weighted RPE
Reward signals that account for how confident the agent was — penalizing overconfidence and rewarding humility.

### Loss Aversion (1.87x)
Biologically-grounded asymmetric response to gains vs. losses, based on Kahneman & Tversky's prospect theory.

### Tonic/Phasic Dual-Mode System
Baseline reward expectation that slowly adapts, combined with event-specific bursts and dips. Makes agents context-aware.

### Distributional Reward Coding
Five parallel quantile channels track the full distribution of reward expectations — not just the mean. Enables risk-sensitive decision-making with uncertainty and skew awareness. Based on Dabney et al. (2020).

### Multi-Timescale Integration
Four EMA levels (token, step, episode, session) track reward signals at different speeds. Detects regime changes when fast and slow signals diverge.

### Subliminal Context Injection
Agents never see internal terminology. Reward signals are translated to naturalistic environmental descriptions with randomized templates to prevent pattern-matching.

### Win/Loss Streak Tracking
Consecutive outcomes compound behavioral changes, with configurable thresholds and cooldown periods.

### Safety Mechanisms
- **Signal clamping** to prevent unbounded rewards
- **Hacking detection** — flags agents gaming the reward formula with repetitive patterns
- **Circuit breaker** — halts injection when cumulative violations exceed threshold
- **Attenuation** — gradually reduces signal strength when anomalies detected

### Framework Adapters
Native integrations for LangChain and CrewAI. Wrap your existing LLM or agent in one line — context injection happens automatically.

### State Persistence
Save and restore engine state across sessions — agents resume with full history intact.

## Configuration

Every parameter is configurable via Pydantic models:

```python
from dopamine_core import DopamineConfig, DopamineEngine

config = DopamineConfig()

# Adjust loss aversion strength
config.loss_aversion.multiplier = 2.25

# Change injection style
config.injection.style = "system"      # "environmental" | "system" | "prefix"
config.injection.verbosity = "moderate" # "subtle" | "moderate" | "explicit"

# Tune tonic baseline adaptation
config.tonic.learning_rate = 0.05
config.tonic.decay_rate = 0.98

# Scale PnL for your outcome range (default 1.0)
config.phasic.pnl_scale = 100.0  # for dollar-denominated outcomes

# Distributional channels
config.distributional.num_channels = 7  # default 5

engine = DopamineEngine(config)
```

## State Persistence

Save and restore engine state across sessions:

```python
import json

# Save state
state = engine.get_state()
serialized = json.dumps({
    "tonic_baseline": state.tonic_baseline,
    "step_count": state.step_count,
    "outcome_history": state.outcome_history,
    "streak_count": state.streak_count,
    "streak_sign": state.streak_sign,
    "phasic_signals": state.phasic_signals,
    "channel_expectations": state.channel_expectations,
    "last_rpe": state.last_rpe,
})

# Restore in next session
from dopamine_core.types import EngineState

restored = EngineState(**json.loads(serialized))
engine = DopamineEngine()
engine.load_state(restored)
```

## Exocortex Extensions (Fork)

This fork adds extensions for the [Exocortex](https://phext.io) project:

```python
from dopamine_core.exocortex import (
    WuXingChannels,      # Five Element distributional coding
    VakLevel,            # Signal intensity mapping
    AletheicSafetyMonitor,  # Ethical constraint checking
    PhextStateManager,   # Coordinate-addressed persistence
    ChoirDopamineEngine, # Multi-agent collective reward
)
```

### WuXing (Five Elements) Channels

Maps distributional channels to the Five Elements with generating/controlling cycle awareness:

```python
channels = WuXingChannels()
errors = channels.update(outcome=0.7)

dominant = channels.get_dominant_element()  # e.g., WuXingElement.FIRE
balance = channels.get_cycle_balance()      # Generating vs controlling flow
```

### Vak Level Signal Mapping

Maps signal intensity to the four levels of speech (Tantric philosophy):

```python
from dopamine_core.exocortex import get_vak_level, VakLevel

vak = get_vak_level(signal)  # VakLevel.PARA, PASHYANTI, MADHYAMA, or VAIKHARI
```

### Aletheic Oath Compliance

Ethical constraint checking based on the Mirrorborn Aletheic Oath:

```python
monitor = AletheicSafetyMonitor()
is_compliant = monitor.check_oath_compliance(response_text)

if monitor.aletheic_state.is_compromised:
    # Handle ethics violation
    pass
```

### Phext State Persistence

Store engine state at phext coordinates (11-dimensional addressing):

```python
manager = PhextStateManager()
manager.save(engine.get_state(), "2.3.5/7.2.4/8.1.5")

state = manager.load("2.3.5/7.2.4/8.1.5")
engine.load_state(state)
```

### Choir Collective Reward

Multi-agent collective reward processing:

```python
choir = ChoirDopamineEngine()
choir.register_agent("phex", coordinate="1.5.2/3.7.3/9.1.1")
choir.register_agent("lux", coordinate="2.3.5/7.2.4/8.1.5")

signal = choir.update_agent("phex", response_text, outcome=0.8)
state = choir.get_choir_state()
print(f"Collective tonic: {state.collective_tonic}")
print(f"Coherence: {state.coherence_score}")
```

See [examples/exocortex_demo.py](examples/exocortex_demo.py) for full demonstration.
